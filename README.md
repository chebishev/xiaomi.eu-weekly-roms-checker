# xiaomi.eu-roms-checker

A small tool for monitoring new **xiaomi.eu ROM releases** from SourceForge.  
Originally designed for Weekly ROMs, now updated to work with the new **Stable / HyperOS** structure.

## ✨ Features

### **1. SourceForge Folder Scanner**
Automatically crawls the xiaomi.eu SourceForge project and:
- discovers all device folders (with recursive folder parsing)
- detects newly added folders or versions
- returns the **newest** or **last modified** ROM folder  
- prints or sends the result

### **2. Thread & Changelog Fetching (deprecated for Weekly)**
Previously supported checking the newest thread from the *xiaomi.eu Weekly section*.  
This function remains available but Weekly ROMs are no longer released.

### **3. Telegram Notifications**
Send results directly to:
- your **Telegram account**, or
- your **Telegram channel**

Fully optional—if not configured, results print to console.
You need TOKEN from https://t.me/Botfather and CHANNEL_NAME.
(see the env_sample file)
