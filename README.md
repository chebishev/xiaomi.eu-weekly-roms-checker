# xiaomi.eu-weekly-roms-checker
Now is with two functionalities:
1. It simply checks for new folders in the cloud and returns a link to the newest folder(or last modified, because it mainly depends of the date of modification)
2. It goes directly to the newest thread in xiaomi.eu Weekly roms section
and gets latest links and changelog

If you have the needed data you can send the result directly to your telegram account or your telegram channel
Otherwise just use the file sourceforge_new_folder_checker.py or sourceforge_new_folder_checker.py to have the result in the console
